 conditional statement are used to handle conditions in the program. 
These statements provides decisions based on the conditions encountered by the program

Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?
There are conidtional statemts in python helpful in decision making of the program it checks the expression and if its true,
then excecute the body of the if statement (any of the operations to perform) elif is used to check another expression and  excecute the body of the if statement  and  
after if condition , then else it doesnt check for condtion but executes the statemets in its body if none of the statementsmes of if and elif body  are excecuted

Q40. What is a tuple? How is it different from list?

A collection of ordered and immutable objects is known as a tuple.  Tuples and lists are different because we cannot modify tuples, although we can modify lists after creating them,
and also because we use parentheses to create tuples while we use square brackets to create lists.

Q51. What is frozen set?

Frozen set is just an immutable version of a Python set object. 

Q52. How is frozen set different from set?

frozensets are immutable, which implies that once generated, elements from the frozenset cannot be added or removed. 
 This function accepts any iterable object as input and transforms it into an immutable object, where as in a set elements can be removed or added

Q53. What is union() in sets? Explain via code.
The union() method returns a set that contains all items from the original set, and all items from the specified set

y = { "d", "a"}
result = x.intersection(y) 
print(result)

In Python is a control flow statement that is used to repeatedly execute a group of statements as long as the condition is satisfied. 

Q69. How many type of loop are there in Python?
There are two types of loops in Python, for and while.

Q70. What is the difference between for and while loops?
The for loop is used when we know the number of iterations,how many times a statement must be executed.
 A while loop is used when the number of iterations is unknown

Q71. What is the use of continue statement?
A continue statement ends the current iteration of a loop. and passes the control to the begining of the next iteration.


Q72. What is the use of break statement?
 It is used to control the sequence of the loop like  to terminate a loop 

Q73. What is the use of pass statement?

The pass statement is used as a placeholder for future code. 
When the pass statement is executed, nothing happens, but we  avoid getting an error when empty code is not allowed.
