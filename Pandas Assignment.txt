Q1. How do you load a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame?

By using pandas library 

import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
print(df) 


Q2. How do you check the data type of a column in a Pandas DataFrame?

using dtypes method  
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
df.dtype gives the datatype of the coulmns 

Q3. How do you select rows from a Pandas DataFrame based on a condition?
 We can select  the rows with the help of head and tail methods 
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
print(df.head(10)) #returns the first 10 rows
print(df.tail(10)) #returns the last 10 rows
 

Q4. How do you rename columns in a Pandas DataFrame?

By using the  rename method on dataframe 

df.rename(columns = {'oldcolumnname':'new_coulmn_name'}, inplace = True)


Q5. How do you drop columns in a Pandas DataFrame?

using the drop method on the coulmn  to be dropped 

df.drop(['A'], axis=1)

here droping the coulmn A

Q6. How do you find the unique values in a column of a Pandas DataFrame?

    df['Pclass'].unique()
By using the unique mwthod on the coulumn  of the data frame 

Q7. How do you find the number of missing values in each column of a Pandas DataFrame?
BY performing isnull() method on the dataframe and then  using sum() to get the  count of missing values in the coulmn

df.isnull().sum()

Q8. How do you fill missing values in a Pandas DataFrame with a specific value?
By using the method df.fillna(specicficvalue)  which repleces the missiing or empty values by specific vale

Q9. How do you concatenate two Pandas DataFrames?

Taking 2 indivijual data frames d1,d2 and using concat operation
frames = [d1, d2]
 
res1 = pd.concat(frames)
res1
     

Q10. How do you merge two Pandas DataFrames on a specific column?
To merge two Pandas DataFrames on a specific column, we  can use the merge() method.
df_merged = pd.merge(df1, df2, on='col1')

Q11. How do you group data in a Pandas DataFrame by a specific column and apply an aggregation function?
using groupby function on dataframe and applying aggregrate function on top of it 
df.groupby(['Name']).sum()

here the name cloumn is grouped and sum gives the count of names 

Q12. How do you pivot a Pandas DataFrame?

in oder to pivot a Pandas DataFrame,  we can use the pivot() method. This method allows you to specify the columns  we want to use as the row and column indices,
 and the values to fill in the data cells.

 For example, suppose you have a DataFrame with three columns: A, B, and C. 
You can pivot this DataFrame to create a new one that has A as the row index, B as the column index, and C as the values:

df_pivot = df.pivot(index='A', columns='B', values='C')


Q13. How do you change the data type of a column in a Pandas DataFrame?

We can use astype() method to convert the type  here coulmn A type is changed from integer to strng 
df['A'] = df['A'].astype('str')

Q14. How do you sort a Pandas DataFrame by a specific column?

df.sort_values(by=['column'])


Q15. How do you create a copy of a Pandas DataFrame?
newdf = df.copy()
using the copy() method on dataframe df


Q16. How do you filter rows of a Pandas DataFrame by multiple conditions?

here we have applied some conditions on the dataframes df on col1 and col2 

filtered_rows = df[(df['col1'] > 3) & (df['col2'] < 9)]


Q17. How do you calculate the mean of a column in a Pandas DataFrame?

here mean() method applied on the coulumn Age 
df['Age'].mean()

Q18. How do you calculate the standard deviation of a column in a Pandas DataFrame?
by applying  std() method applied on the coulumn Age 
df['Age'].std()

Q19. How do you calculate the correlation between two columns in a Pandas DataFrame?
using the corr() function 
df['Age'].corr(df['Fare'])

Q20. How do you select specific columns in a DataFrame using their labels?

We can select specific colums using []  on the fataframe 

 selected_columns = df[['col1', 'col3']]  # here selecting the coulmns 1 and column 3 wth labels

Q21. How do you select specific rows in a DataFrame using their indexes?
We can use .loc to select specific indexes  from data frame  eg :selected_rows = df.loc[[0, 2]]
Q22. How do you sort a DataFrame by a specific column?

df.sort_values(by=['column'])

Q23. How do you create a new column in a DataFrame based on the values of another column?

df['new_col'] = df['Survived'] 
here new_col is created based on the values of another Survived


Q24. How do you remove duplicates from a DataFrame?
df.drop_duplicates() , by using drop_duplicates method 

Q25. What is the difference between .loc and .iloc in Pandas?

The main difference between pandas loc[] vs iloc[] is loc gets DataFrame rows & columns by labels/names and iloc[] gets by integer Index/position.
